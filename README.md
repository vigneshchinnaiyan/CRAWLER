# Scraping Methods for CRAWLZ

These different methods implement different ways of collecting data from Facebook, Google, Foursquare and SGPBusiness, and is used for the CRAWLZ project found over at https://github.com/crawlzstage/infra

The CRAWLZ project uses the Facebook Graph API, the Foursquare API, and Google Places API mainly for retrieving data. The LinkedIn and SGPBusiness scrapers are prototypical scrapers that was implemented at the start but was not used later on for the final product.

## Install Dependencies

First, clone the repo.
Then run this in the terminal


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Business Scraper and breaking reCAPTCHA

The Business Scraper is not used in the final product of CRAWLZ, but is more of a proof of concept for beating Google's reCAPTCHA. The idea of breaking Google's reCAPTCHA through its audio challenge came from another Github repository: https://github.com/eastee/rebreakcaptcha

The Business uses Scrapy to scrape through the website. Scrapy can be installed via:

`pip install Scrapy`

It will be installed when installing the other dependencies as well. In order to run the scraper for SGPBusiness, navigate to the FYP/sgpbusiness/sgpbusiness_scraper folder then run this command:

`scrapy crawl sgpbusiness`

If you want an output file, run this command:

`scrapy crawl sgpbusiness -o sgpbusiness_output.jl`


## LinkedIn initial scraper

The LinkedIn initial scraper is not used in the main project and is only listed here as a proof-of-concept, however due to LinkedIn's strict policy of web crawlers, we did not use it in the end for the main project. It is recommended not to run the program for a long time to prevent any legal issues. The code is based on a code found here: https://www.scrapehero.com/tutorial-scraping-linkedin-for-public-company-data/

You can try running the LinkedIn prototype scraper by navigating to the linkedin_scraper folder then running `python linkedin_initial.py`. The response returned by linkedin will be responses consisting of 200 and 999. 200 means it managed to retrieve company data, 999 means it failed. Use Ctrl-C in the middle of the program run to retrieve an output file named 'data.json'


## CAPTCHA

This is a proof of concept for breaking simple CAPTCHA images using the algorithm in the report. This code will break the image file named 'new_captcha.png' in the same folder.

`python captcha_handler.py`

## Facebook Graph API

In order to start using the Facebook Graph API, you must first obtain an Access Token from Facebook and set it as an environment variable. For more information, refer to here:
https://developers.facebook.com/


## Google Place API

To start using Google Places API, you need to retrieve a Google API Key. Navigate here to find out more:
https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro

## Foursquare API

To start using Foursquare API, you need to retrieve a Client Id and Client Secret which can be retrieved after setting up and creating a new app.

For the code that we use, we only require Client ID and Client Secret to retrieve userless access. For more information:
